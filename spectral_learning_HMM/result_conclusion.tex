Song et al.\cite{ref20} performed some experiments to evaluate the effectiveness
of learning embedded HMMs, where in each case the learned embedded HMM was compared to several alternative
time series models including (I) linear dynamical
systems (LDS) learned by Subspace Identification
(Subspace ID)\cite{ref13} with
stability constraints \cite{ref25}, (II) discrete
HMMs learned by EM, and (III) the Reduced-rank
HMM (RR-HMM) learned by spectral methods \cite{ref7}. In the experiments Song et al.\cite{ref20} demonstrate how
the kernel spectral learning algorithm for embedded
HMMs achieves the state-of-the-art performance.
